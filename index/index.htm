                    <p class="wikiinfo">
                        Players explore the game's large fantasy world, called Teyvat, 
                        with over 54 characters and various points of interest spread 
                        across the map. The game features an action combat playstyle 
                        that allows the player to swap between 4 individual characters 
                        in a party to quickly combo attacks. Single-player gameplay is 
                        the focus of the game, with Co-Op Mode available for certain 
                        activities.

                    <p class="wikiinfo">
                        Each character has two unique combat skills: an Elemental Skill 
                        and an Elemental Burst. The Elemental Skill can be used at any 
                        time except for the cooldown period immediately after use, 
                        while the Elemental Burst has an Energy Cost, requiring the user 
                        to amass sufficient Energy first.
                    </p>
                    <p class="wikiinfo">
                        Characters have control over one of seven natural elements: 
                        <span style="color: #00a6a4;">Anemo</span>, 
                        <span style="color: #00ffff;">Cryo</span>, 
                        <span style="color: #00ff00;">Dendro</span>,

                        Combining these elements using Elemental Reactions is 
                        encouraged to quickly defeat enemies.

                    <p class="wikiinfo">
                        Players can venture inside Domains, temple-like instances 
                        scattered across the map, to complete the challenges within 
                        and obtain either one-time rewards or certain materials 
                        required for character development. Once characters are 
                        properly geared, players can choose to enter the Spiral 
                        Abyss, a special type of Domain consisting of different 
                        floors of combat challenges.

                        Cooking and crafting are other significant aspects of 
                        Genshin Impact's gameplay. Players gather many resources 
                        in the course of their adventure, some of which can 
                        be turned into dishes via cooking, and potions and 
                        ascension materials via crafting. Dishes can regenerate 
                        characters' health, boost attack or defensive abilities, 
                        and decrease stamina consumption, while potions can increase 
                        a character's resistance against or damage for an element.

                        Further progression in the game unlocks the Housing system, 
                        known as the Serenitea Pot, in which players can create 
                        furnishings and place them in a realm layout, gaining 
                        access to rewards and level-up materials.

                    <p class="wikiinfo">
                        The Fishing system allows players to catch fish, which 
                        can be displayed in the Serenitea Pot, exchanged at 
                        each nation's Fishing Association for rewards, or processed 
                    into fish as a cooking ingredient.

                        The story of Genshin Impact takes place in the world of Teyvat 
                        which is home to seven major nations:  
                        <span style=" color: #005fff;">Mondstadt</span>,
                        <span style=" color: #a85a00;">Liyue</span>,
                        <span style=" color: #ff00bf;">Inazuma</span>,
                        <span style=" color: #00ff00;">Sumeru</span>,
                        <span style=" color: #005fff;">Fontaine</span>,
                        <span style=" color: #ff0000;">Natlan</span>,
                        and 
                        <span style=" color: #00ffff;">Snezhnaya</span>.
                        These nations are ruled over by deities known as Archons, 
                        part of a group of gods called "The Seven." Each Archon is 
                        associated with one of the seven elements of Teyvat, which 
                        are also reflected in their nation's landscape and culture. 
                        For example, the nation of Mondstadt is ruled over by 
                        Barbatos the Anemo Archon
                        , and so the element of wind is an important symbol known by 
                        its people. Apart from the seven nations, there was the nation of  
                        <span style=" color: #505050;">Khaenri'ah</span>
                        that lived independently from the authority of gods.

                        <span style=" color: #ffff00;">Celestia</span>
                        is the main heavenly body that presides over 
                        Teyvat and is in direct connection with The Seven. 
                        A floating island seen in the sky is believed to be 
                        it, allegedly the home to gods and also mortals who 
                        have ascended to godhood. Humans that are granted 
                        Visions, magical gems that grant bearers the ability 
                        to command elemental power, are called "allogenes" — 
                        ones with the potential to reach godhood.

                    <p class="wikiinfo">
                        While gods rule, the nations also have their own 
                        human governing bodies: the Knights of Favonius to 
                        Mondstadt, the Qixing to Liyue, the Shogunate to Inazuma, 
                        and the Akademiya to Sumeru.
